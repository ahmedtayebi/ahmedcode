        solution: "Built a comprehensive medical student platform with Next.js featuring organized study materials by year/semester, interactive question banks, exam archives, and a student forum. Implemented RTL-optimized design with smooth animations and a search system for quick resource discovery.",

        solution: "Developed a Next.js SaaS dashboard with real-time data visualization, customizable widgets, and AI-generated insights. Built a drag-and-drop interface for creating custom reports and automated anomaly detection to surface important trends.",
