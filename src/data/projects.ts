        tagline: "Next-gen mobile commerce experience",
        problem: "Traditional e-commerce apps struggle with discovery and trust. Users abandon carts due to complex checkout flows and lack of personalization, leading to conversion rates under 2%.",
        thinking: "I analyzed user behavior patterns across 50+ shopping sessions and identified three key friction points: overwhelming product catalogs, uncertain sizing, and multi-step checkout. The solution needed to address each while maintaining a premium feel.",
        solution: "Built a Flutter-based mobile app featuring AI-powered product recommendations, AR try-on capabilities, and one-tap checkout. Implemented a machine learning model that adapts to user preferences in real-time, reducing decision fatigue by 65%.",
        results: "Increased conversion rate to 8.2%, reduced cart abandonment by 47%, and achieved 4.8★ rating on both app stores with 12K+ downloads in the first month.",

        tagline: "Real-time business intelligence platform",
        problem: "Small businesses lack access to enterprise-grade analytics tools. Existing solutions are either too expensive ($500+/month) or too complex for non-technical users to derive actionable insights.",
        thinking: "The challenge was building powerful analytics without overwhelming users. I studied how product managers at Fortune 500 companies use data and distilled those workflows into intuitive visual patterns accessible to small business owners.",
        solution: "Developed a Next.js SaaS dashboard with real-time data visualization, customizable widgets, and AI-generated insights. Built a drag-and-drop interface for creating custom reports and automated anomaly detection to surface important trends.",
        results: "Onboarded 240+ businesses in beta, with users reporting 3.5 hours saved per week on reporting tasks. 89% of users created their first custom dashboard within 10 minutes of signup.",

        tagline: "Humanizing digital banking for Gen Z",
        problem: "Traditional banking apps intimidate younger users with financial jargon and sterile interfaces. 62% of Gen Z users report anxiety when checking their bank balance due to poor information hierarchy and lack of financial guidance.",
        thinking: "Banking doesn't have to feel like accounting. I researched how Gen Z communicates about money (think: fintwit, money diaries) and translated those patterns into an interface that feels more like a financial companion than a ledger.",
        solution: "Designed a complete mobile banking experience with conversational insights, gamified savings goals, and contextual financial education. Created a visual language that transforms intimidating numbers into encouraging progress narratives.",
        results: "Prototype tested with 35 users aged 18-25, achieving an average SUS score of 87. 94% reported they would switch to this bank based on the design alone. Selected as a Finalist in the 2025 Adobe Design Awards.",

        problem: "Generic workout apps fail to adapt to individual progress and recovery needs. 73% of users abandon fitness apps within 30 days due to unrealistic plans and lack of motivation.",
        thinking: "Fitness is deeply personal and context-dependent. A great workout app should function like a personal trainer who knows when to push you and when to dial it back. I designed around three pillars: adaptation, motivation, and community.",
        solution: "Created a React Native app that uses machine learning to adjust workout intensity based on sleep quality, heart rate variability, and performance trends. Integrated social features for accountability and celebration of milestones.",
        results: "Beta cohort showed 68% 90-day retention (vs. industry average of 27%). Users completed an average of 4.2 workouts per week, with 82% reporting the adaptive programming as the key differentiator.",
